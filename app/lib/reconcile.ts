/**
 * The tenant RECONCILE sweep (#3718 — Shopify review 5.1.2).
 *
 * The app's own row can say `published` while the storefront chat cannot open:
 *   • ORPHANED — the platform no longer resolves the tenant (our demo store:
 *     `bmaiTenantId` 8fdb70ee… gone, launch 403 `tenant_not_found`). Detected
 *     from the platform's own answer (`readiness.state === "orphaned"`) or the
 *     meter's `tenantUnreachableAt` — repaired WITHOUT any flag;
 *   • STUCK — the published revision failed to activate (the review store's
 *     reinstall deadlock: `runtime.state = error`);
 *   • DOMAINS MISSING — the store has a storefront domain (a custom domain
 *     connected after install, or any row provisioned before 0.1.12) that the
 *     published allowlist does not carry;
 *   • LIVE BUT NOT FRAMEABLE — the platform refuses the storefront, a custom
 *     domain, or the Theme Editor chain.
 * This classifies every row from the same reads Home and afterAuth use (runtime
 * readiness via MCP, the store's domains via the Admin API, frameability via the
 * public embed-status answer) and names ONE action: re-run the idempotent
 * provisioning lifecycle, or nothing.
 *
 * PURE. The script (`scripts/reconcile-tenants.ts`) does the I/O and applies
 * only with `--apply`; uninstalled (suspended) shops are never touched.
