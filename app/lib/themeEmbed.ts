 * checklist Home renders, and a scope-free embed detector.
 *
 * Activation uses SHOPIFY_API_KEY (the app client_id), not a CDN asset UUID.
 * Shopify deprecated extension UUID activation links. Detection matches the
 * extension asset + this store's slug, never a CDN UUID (#3718).
 * https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/online-store/theme-app-extensions/configuration
 *
 * LEAST PRIVILEGE: no `read_themes` scope. Embed status is detected from the
 * PUBLIC storefront HTML (does it load the extension asset?). A password-
 * protected dev store or any non-200 is "unknown" — never a false "off".
