/**
 * The tenant provisioning lifecycle — the install/re-auth convergence, expressed
 * as ONE injectable orchestrator so it is unit-testable WITHOUT a live Shopify
 * Partner app, a real shop, or the bmai control plane.
 *
 * ALL-OPS-VIA-MCP: every control-plane effect flows through `deps.call` (an MCP
 * `tools/call`). This module never touches Prisma or fetch directly — the caller
 * (bmai.server) injects the real MCP client + tenant-store; tests inject mocks.
 *
 * AUTHORIZATION = PROOF-OF-SHOP. The partner tools are authorized by an
 * HMAC proof-of-shop (partner+shop+proof+ts) the app signs (`partnerProof.ts`),
 * NOT a platform-operator credential. `provision_partner_tenant` homes the calling
 * OAuth identity as the tenant's ADMIN, so the tenant-admin config tools
 * (set_tenant_branding / upsert_tenant_support_connector / publish_tenant_runtime)
 * are then authorized by that same identity. The serving host is the derived slug
 * lane `<slug>.busymate.ai` (bmdev tenancy resolve.ts), so NO operator-only
 * `set_tenant_domain` is needed; the storefront origins are allowlisted for iframe
 * embedding via `add_tenant_embed_origin` (proof path).
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED / NEVER-PARK: provision + publish are LOAD-BEARING — a failure in
 * either records an error state and STOPS (no fake success, no publish on a broken
 * tenant). The branding / embed-origin / connector / merchant-admin steps are
 * BEST-EFFORT: a soft failure is recorded but does not abort a tenant that was
 * created and taken live. Every step is idempotent, so a re-run (every re-auth) is
 * safe.
